      <h1 align="center">71. Nuh (Noah)</h1>

      <h2>71. Nuh (Noah)</h2>
      <p>Surely We sent Nuh to his people, saying: Warn your people before there come upon
         them a painful chastisement.
      </p>
      <p>He said: O my people! Surely I am a plain warner to you:</p>
      <p>That you should serve Allah and be careful of (your duty to) Him and obey me:</p>
      <p>He will forgive you some of your faults and grant you a delay to an appointed term;
         surely the term of Allah when it comes is not postponed; did you but know!
      </p>
      <p>He said: O my Lord! surely I have called my people by night and by day!</p>
      <p>But my call has only made them flee the more:</p>
      <p>And whenever I have called them that Thou mayest forgive them, they put their fingers
         in their ears, cover themselves with their garments, and persist and are puffed up
         with pride:
      </p>
      <p>Then surely I called to them aloud:</p>
      <p>Then surely I spoke to them in public and I spoke to them in secret:</p>
      <p>Then I said, Ask forgiveness of your Lord, surely He is the most Forgiving:</p>
      <p>He will send down upon you the cloud, pouring down abundance of rain:</p>
      <p>And help you with wealth and sons, and make for you gardens, and make for you
         rivers.
      </p>
      <p>What is the matter with you that you fear not the greatness of Allah?</p>
      <p>And indeed He has created you through various grades:</p>
      <p>Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens, one above another,</p>
      <p>And made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp?</p>
      <p>And Allah has made you grow out of the earth as a growth:</p>
      <p>Then He returns you to it, then will He bring you forth a (new) bringing forth:</p>
      <p>And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse,</p>
      <p>That you may go along therein in wide paths.</p>
      <p>Nuh said: My Lord! surely they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and
         children have added to him nothing but loss.
      </p>
      <p>And they have planned a very great plan.</p>
      <p>And they say: By no means leave your gods, nor leave Wadd, nor Suwa; nor Yaghus, and
         Yauq and Nasr.
      </p>
      <p>And indeed they have led astray many, and do not increase the unjust in aught but
         error.
      </p>
      <p>Because of their wrongs they were drowned, then made to enter fire, so they did not
         find any helpers besides Allah.
      </p>
      <p>And Nuh said: My Lord! leave not upon the land any dweller from among the
         unbelievers:
      </p>
      <p>For surely if Thou leave them they will lead astray Thy servants, and will not beget
         any but immoral, ungrateful (children)
      </p>
      <p>My Lord! forgive me and my parents and him who enters my house believing, and the
         believing men and the believing women; and do not increase the unjust in aught but
         destruction!
