      <h2>93. The Early Hours</h2>
      <p>I swear by the early hours of the day,</p>
      <p>And the night when it covers with darkness.</p>
      <p>Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor has He become displeased,</p>
      <p>And surely what comes after is better for you than that which has gone before.</p>
      <p>And soon will your Lord give you so that you shall be well pleased.</p>
      <p>Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter?</p>
      <p>And find you lost (i.e. unrecognized by men) and guide (them to you)?</p>
      <p>And find you in want and make you to be free from want?</p>
      <p>Therefore, as for the orphan, do not oppress (him).</p>
      <p>And as for him who asks, do not chide (him),</p>
      <p>And as for the favor of your Lord, do announce (it).</p>
