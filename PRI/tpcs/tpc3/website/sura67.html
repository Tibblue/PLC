      <h1 align="center">67. The Kingdom</h1>
      <h3 align="center">In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. </h3>

      <h2>67. The Kingdom</h2>
      <p>Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He has power over all things,</p>
      <p>Who created death and life that He may try you — which of you is best in deeds;
         and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving,
      </p>
      <p>Who created the seven heavens one above another; you see no incongruity in the
         creation of the Beneficent God; then look again, can you see any disorder?
      </p>
      <p>Then turn back the eye again and again; your look shall come back to you confused
         while it is fatigued.
      </p>
      <p>And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with ( lamps and We have made these
         missiles for the Shaitans, and We have prepared for them the chastisement of
         burning.
      </p>
      <p>And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of hell, and evil is
         the
         resort.
      </p>
      <p>When they shall be cast therein, they shall hear a loud moaning of it as it
         heaves,
      </p>
      <p>Almost bursting for fury. Whenever a group is cast into it, its keeper shall ask
         them: Did there not come to you a warner?
      </p>
      <p>They shall say: Yea! indeed there came to us a warner, but we rejected (him) and
         said: Allah has not revealed anything, you are only in a great error.
      </p>
      <p>And they shall say: Had we but listened or pondered, we should not have been among
         the inmates of the burning fire.
      </p>
      <p>So they shall acknowledge their sins, but far will be (forgiveness) from the inmates
         of the burning fire.
      </p>
      <p>(As for) those who fear their Lord in secret, they shall surely have forgiveness and
         a great reward.
      </p>
      <p>And conceal your word or manifest it; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the
         hearts.
      </p>
      <p>Does He not know, Who created? And He is the Knower of the subtleties, the Aware.</p>
      <p>He it is Who made the earth smooth for you, therefore go about in the spacious sides
         thereof, and eat of His sustenance, and to Him is the return after death.
      </p>
      <p>Are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not make the earth to swallow
         you up? Then lo! it shall be in a state of commotion.
      </p>
      <p>Or are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not send down upon you a
         punishment? Then shall you know how was My warning.
      </p>
      <p>And certainly those before them rejected (the truth), then how was My
         disapproval.
      </p>
      <p>Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their wings) and contracting
         (them)? What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent God? Surely He sees
         everything.
      </p>
      <p>Or who is it that will be a host for you to assist you besides the Beneficent God?
         The unbelievers are only in deception.
      </p>
      <p>Or who is it that will give you sustenance if He should withhold His sustenance? Nay!
         they persist in disdain and aversion.
      </p>
      <p>What! is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon
         a
         straight path?
      </p>
      <p>Say: He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the ears and the eyes and
         the hearts: little is it that you give thanks.
      </p>
      <p>Say: He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered.</p>
      <p>And they say: When shall this threat be (executed) if you are truthful?</p>
      <p>Say: The knowledge (thereof) is only with Allah and I am only a plain warner.</p>
      <p>But when they shall see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve shall be sorry,
         and it shall be said; This is that which you used to call for.
      </p>
      <p>Say: Have you considered if Allah should destroy me and those with me — rather
         He will have mercy on us; yet who will protect the unbelievers from a painful
         punishment?
      </p>
      <p>Say: He is the Beneficent God, we believe in Him and on Him do we rely, so you shall
         come to know who it is that is in clear error.
      </p>
      <p>Say: Have you considered if your water should go down, who is it then that will bring
         you flowing water?
